## Predicting Absentism using Machine Learning


This notebook will introduce some foundation machine learning and data science concepts by exploring the problem of Absentism **classification**.

It is intended to be an end-to-end example of what a data science and machine learning **proof of concept** might look like.

## What is classification?

Classification involves deciding whether a sample is part of one class or another (**single-class classification**). If there are multiple class options, it's referred to as **multi-class classification**.

More specifically, we'll look at the following topics.

* **Exploratory data analysis (EDA)** - the process of going through a dataset and finding out more about it.
* **Model training** - create model(s) to learn to predict a target variable based on other variables.
* **Model evaluation** - evaluating a models predictions using problem-specific evaluation metrics. 

To work through these topics, we'll use pandas, Matplotlib and NumPy for data anaylsis, as well as, Scikit-Learn for machine learning and modelling tasks.
